# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Base currency, its minor-unit exponent and its display symbol are now driven by
  `config/money.php` and the Settings screen instead of being fixed to one currency.
  `App\Support\Currency` resolves them, with a saved setting taking precedence over
  the environment default.
- Display timezone falls back to `APP_DISPLAY_TIMEZONE` (default `UTC`) rather than a
  hardcoded zone.
- Demo seeders use generic, obviously fake data throughout.
- The seeder now generates and prints a random admin password outside `local` and
  `testing`, instead of silently seeding a known one. `ADMIN_PASSWORD` overrides it.
- The demo seeders no longer run outside `local` and `testing`, so `migrate --seed`
  can no longer create fake projects or financial records on a real installation.
  `SEED_DEMO_DATA` forces the decision either way.

### Added

- Open-source project files: MIT `LICENSE`, rewritten `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, this changelog, GitHub Actions CI, and issue
  and pull request templates.
- SIL Open Font License notices for the bundled Geist, Geist Mono and Instrument Sans
  subsets (`resources/fonts/LICENSE`).
- `tests/Feature/SmokeRenderTest.php` renders every parameterless page and the main
  detail pages against the demo dataset.
- `tests/Feature/CurrencyTest.php` covers zero-, two- and three-decimal currencies,
  frozen-rate conversion across differing exponents, and settings-over-config
  precedence.

### Fixed

- Currency column defaults no longer ship as one organisation's currency
  (new migration; the original migrations are untouched).

## [1.0.0]

First complete release. Built as seven milestones, each shipped and verified before
the next began.

### Milestone 1 — Foundation

- Laravel application skeleton, authentication, password reset.
- Many-to-many roles and permissions: 49 granular permissions across 5 seeded roles
  (admin, partner, supervisor, staff, accountant). Effective permissions are the union
  of a user's roles; no `role` column and no role switcher.
- User administration, activation state, and an app settings store.
- Application shell: navigation rail, top bar, command palette, mobile drawer and
  thumb bar.
- Design system: tokens, dark mode, density modes and a Blade component library.
- Seeders for roles, permissions, settings and task templates.

### Milestone 2 — Projects & credentials

- Project portfolio CRUD with status, CMS, niche, monetisation state, acquisition cost.
- Per-project ownership shares validated to total 100%, and team assignment that scopes
  staff visibility.
- Encrypted credential vault, with reveal gated by its own permission and every reveal
  written to an audit log.
- Scheduled credential expiry alerts with configurable warning windows.
- Portfolio dashboard.

### Milestone 3 — Work

- Tasks with checklists, priorities, due dates, attachments, comments and evidence
  on submit.
- Recurring task generation and reusable task templates.
- Article pipeline from brief to published, with word-count targets and per-article cost.
- Link building log with per-project monthly budgets.
- A single keyboard-driven approval queue across tasks, articles and links, optionally
  raising the matching expense on approval.

### Milestone 4 — People

- Attendance derived from the first login of the day, with a configurable late hour,
  plus supervisor leave and holiday marking.
- Login history with IP and user agent.
- Daily work logs.
- Monthly scorecards aggregating output per person, costed against mixed pay rates
  (monthly salary and/or per-article, per-link, per-task).

### Milestone 5 — Money

- Revenue per project per month, entered directly or imported from CSV, with the FX
  rate frozen on each row so historical figures never re-convert.
- Direct and shared expenses, receipt uploads, recurring expense templates, paid state.
- Monthly profit and loss with shared costs allocated across projects in proportion
  to revenue.
- Manual partner distributions computed from ownership shares; approving a run locks it
  permanently, and corrections are new adjusting entries.
- Partner ledger and per-partner statements for capital, withdrawals and distribution
  credits.
- All monetary values stored as integer minor units.

### Milestone 6 — Deployment

- FTP packaging scripts for shared hosting (`deploy/package.sh`, `deploy/package.ps1`)
  producing an app archive and a public archive.
- Dual-path `public/index.php` that works both in the split shared-hosting layout and
  locally.
- Token-gated `/_ops/{action}` maintenance route for hosts without SSH, disabled
  entirely when no token is set.
- `storage:link` fallback that copies when `symlink()` is unavailable, plus a public
  media fallback route.
- Pure-PHP database backup command requiring no `mysqldump` or shell access.
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`.

### Milestone 7 — AI assistant

- Optional natural-language "ask your data" assistant and drafted monthly summaries,
  completely hidden when no provider key is configured.
- Questions map onto a fixed whitelist of read-only report methods that re-apply the
  caller's permissions and project scope; a model never generates executed SQL.
- Credentials, passwords, keys and bank details are stripped before any prompt is built.
- Monthly spend cap, per-request token and cost logging, and response caching.
